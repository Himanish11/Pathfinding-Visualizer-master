# Pathfinding Visualizer

A web-based pathfinding visualizer that demonstrates the functionality of various pathfinding algorithms. This tool allows users to visualize how algorithms navigate through a grid to find the shortest path between two points. It also includes multiple maze patterns for creating custom environments, enabling deeper insights into how different algorithms perform.

## Features

- Visualizes popular pathfinding algorithms such as:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm (Weighted)
  - A* Search (Weighted)
  - Greedy Best-First Search
  - Swarm Algorithm
  - Convergent Swarm Algorithm
  - Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm
  - Breadth-First Search (Unweighted)
  - Depth-First Search (Unweighted)
  
- Maze generation patterns:
  - Recursive Division
  - Recursive Division (Vertical Skew)
  - Recursive Division (Horizontal Skew)
  - Basic Random Maze
  - Basic Weight Maze
  - Simple Stair Pattern

- Interactive UI:
  - Set start and end points manually
  - Add or remove walls on the grid
  - Adjust grid size and speed of the visualization
  - Reset the grid and visualization
  - Toggle between different algorithms

6. Reset or adjust settings as needed.

## Pathfinding Algorithms

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Guarantees the shortest path and works with weighted grids.
- **A* Search**: An informed search algorithm using heuristics to speed up the search, optimal and complete.
- **Greedy Best-First Search**: A faster algorithm, but does not guarantee the shortest path.
- **Swarm Algorithm**: A less optimal algorithm that mimics the behavior of a swarm. It balances between exploration and exploitation.
- **Convergent Swarm Algorithm**: A modified version of the Swarm Algorithm that converges towards the target faster.
- **Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm**: Similar to the Swarm Algorithm but expands from both start and end points.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all possible nodes layer by layer, guaranteeing the shortest path on unweighted grids.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking; may not find the shortest path.

## Maze Patterns

- **Recursive Division**: A divide-and-conquer approach to generating mazes.
- **Recursive Division (Vertical Skew)**: A variation of Recursive Division with a vertical skew in the wall placements.
- **Recursive Division (Horizontal Skew)**: A variation of Recursive Division with a horizontal skew in the wall placements.
- **Basic Random Maze**: Walls are placed randomly throughout the grid.
- **Basic Weight Maze**: A grid with random weighted cells instead of walls.
- **Simple Stair Pattern**: A simple stair-like structure of walls.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - CSS for grid and visual elements
  - HTML5 for structure

- **Algorithms**:
  - JavaScript implementations of pathfinding and maze generation algorithms

## Future Improvements

- Add additional algorithms (e.g., Jump Point Search)
- Improve maze generation techniques for more complex patterns
- Allow users to save and share their grid configurations
- Add a step-by-step mode for better algorithm understanding
- Optimize algorithm performance for larger grids
